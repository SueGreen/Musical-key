If all outputs agree, then they are right in 92.31% of cases
If all outputs agree, then none is right in 7.69% of cases
	They determined a relative key in 0.00% of cases
	Closely related key in 0.00% of cases
	Something different in 7.69% of cases
If two outputs agree, these two outputs are right in 60.47% of cases. The third one is mistaken. 
	Overall, if two outputs agree and these two outputs are right, then music21 is right in 80.77% of cases
	Music21 determined a relative key in 2% of cases

If two outputs agree, the third one is right in 13.95% of cases
If two outputs agree, none is right in 27.91% of cases
If all outputs are different,they are all wrong in 33.33% of cases
If no output is the same, then there is one right output in 66.67% of cases: 
If no output is the same, then Music21 gives the right answer in 75.00% of cases, if it is mistaken, then it determines a relative key in 0.00% of cases, closely related in 16.67 something different in 8.33% of cases
If no output is the same, then Krumhansl gives the right answer in 25.00% of cases, if it is mistaken, then it determines a relative key in 8.33% of cases, closely related in 16.67 something different in 50.00% of cases
If no output is the same, then Algorithm SA gives the right answer in 0.00% of cases, if it is mistaken, then it determines a relative key in 41.67% of cases, closely related in 16.67 something different in 41.67% of cases
